# weather-app
a-duck-themed-weather-application

I created this weather app as part of the SheCodes Plus workshop. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used bootstrap, openweathermap-API and axios. 
It is duck-themed, as I inluded Cheddar, a cheeky little woolen duck, hence the name "Weather with Cheddar". 
The project is hosted on Netflify and the code is stored on Github.
